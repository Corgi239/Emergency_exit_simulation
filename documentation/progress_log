Phases 1 and 2 of the project are completed.
The simulation functions well enough to facilitate the development and testing of the model.
The project is progressing as scheduled. In my technical plan I expected to be finished with phase 2 by either mid-March or end of March, so I am staying true to my more optimistic prognosis :)

The datastructure Vector2d is implemented and fully tested with Unit tests.
The GUI object (EmergencyExitSimulation) is completed on a basic level. Further development in phase 4.
The functionality of the Room and PersonBody classes is completed, barring their interactions with PersonBrain, which will be developed in phase 3.

The developement is progressing surprisingly smoothly so far. I encountered some difficulties with setting up the project and importing the two needed eternal libraries. I ended up starting a new project with SBT instead of the IDEA based project, which made it a lot easier to import libraries.
Another snag I had to deal with was connected with testing the Vector2d class - I had to find a way to work with Double values in assert statements. Knowledge about implicit classes ended up coming in handy.
I estimate the total workload at 15 hours so far, including research.

Questions:

1) A warning appears during compilation, not sure what I am supposed to do with it
(Class JavaLaunchHelper is implemented in both /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_144.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java (0x10ccb34c0) and /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_144.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/libinstrument.dylib (0x10cd314e0). One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.)

2) So far I have implemented both updating the simulation and redrawing it on the screen in the same thread. I am not sure how to diagnose whether that is currently causing any slowdowns/errors.

3) I am somewhat confused by some of the directories and files that IDEA generates automatically as part of creating an SBT project. I am ok with just ignoring it so far (I do not include most of them in my VCS commits), but I'd love to find a way to learn more about the purpose of those.

4) I wonder if the animations on the webpage http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/Doorway.html are still viewable somehow.
